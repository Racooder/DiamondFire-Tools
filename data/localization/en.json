    "color-codes-explanation": "On DiamondFire, you have the ability customize your text color using <a href='https://htmlcolorcodes.com/minecraft-color-codes/'>minecraft color codes</a> but with a <code>&</code> instead of a <code>§</code>, or html color codes in a special format. Text Helper allows you to write html color codes in their typical format <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp'>#rrggbb</a>, and it will automatically convert them to the DiamondFire format.",
